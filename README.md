🌟 Core FeaturesMulti-Source Ingestion: Seamlessly processes unstructured data from local PDFs and HuggingFace QA datasets.Smart Chunking: Splits large documents into overlapping segments to preserve semantic context across boundaries.Hallucination Guardrails: Enforces strict similarity thresholds. If the context doesn't match the query, the system refuses to "guess."Source Transparency: Every response includes the underlying similarity score and source metadata, allowing for easy auditing of the AI's logic.
